<h2>US Economy: The Short Term</h2><div>Oct 17, 2013 &#8226; 10:26 PM</div><div><p>The US and most of the rest of the developed world is slowly recovering the financial crisis of 2008. But the economy is recovering, and will continue to recover, just as it has from every previous recession.</p><h3>What should government do?</h3><p>Spend less? No. I think of the economy as having momentum, both when growing and when shrinking. When it's shrinking or even just drifting, you don't want any extra pushes in the direction of shrinking. Government spending is part of the economy, so, don't cut in the slump: "The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity."</p><h3>What should the Fed do?</h3><p>Continue Quantitative Easing? Yes. With short-term rates pinned near zero, QE is the next tool in the Fed's box. It is not clear that it directly improves the economy on net, but definitely does seem to stimulate through the expectations channel. Some say QE has risks like unleashing inflation or financial instability, but the only real risk I see is the fairly esoteric collateral shortage risk. <br /><br />What would be better than QE? Target a higher inflation rate, say 4%. This will allow Milton Friedman style conventional monetary policy to facilitate constructive investment in this and future slumps. People generally hate inflation, because they see price increases as inflation, but see pay increases as earned. Actually, however, overall real wage growth does not seem be correlated with the inflation rate. See Larry Ball (the economist not the football player) for a <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/case-4-inflation">more thorough argument</a>. <br /><br />Use Nominal Gross Domestic Product Level Targeting (<a href="http://www.aei-ideas.org/2013/01/mishkin-and-woodford-to-fed-on-ngdp-level-targeting-faster-please/">NGDPLT</a>). This is a technical change in the way the Fed would frame and communicate its goals. Not earth-shattering, but definitely very promising.</p></div>
