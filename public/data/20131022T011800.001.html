<h2>US Economy: The Medium Term</h2><div>Oct 21, 2013 &#8226; 9:18 PM</div><div><p><br />Two issues which will impact the US economy in the medium term are the growing costs of healthcare and education.</p><h2>Healthcare</h2><p>The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt as a percentage of GDP will slowly decrease for about the next five years, and then start to increase, and that it will keep increasing for as far as the (mind's) eye can see. If you dig into the numbers, you will see that this is almost entirely driven by the ever increasing cost of healthcare, which passes through to Medicare, Medicaid, and so on. US healthcare spending has steadily grown from under 6% of GDP in 1960 to nearly 18% of GDP today. The CBO assumes healthcare spending will continue to grow like it has in the past, and if it does the national debt will not be the only victim. But it is not going to happen.<br /><br />The growth of healthcare spending will be restrained - count on it. In fact it's already begun to slow. There will be much political wrangling over how to continue to restrain that growth, but in the end it will be restrained. How? Here are a couple of ideas:<br /><br />The current fee-for-service model, where providers change for every test and procedure, seems to lead to unnecessary and even counter-productive treatment. Moving toward pay-for-performance models could reduce costs without reducing quality.<br /><br />The US effectively has a physicians guild that restricts the supply of healthcare practitioners, thereby increasing their income and increasing the expenses of everyone else. A more free market would help here.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>The higher education market is functioning poorly. This can be expected in any market where consumers do not have enough information. What is a college education worth? Is a more expensive college worth the extra?<br /><br />Certainly a bachelors degree is highly correlated with much higher income later in life. But cause and effect? Young people with economic and intellectual advantages are more likely to go college, and to attend more expensive colleges, and they also tend to earn more later in life. But how much of that is because of college, and how much is due to their economic and intellectual advantages? Studies try to control for such things as family income, parent's level of education, and even parent's business connections. How about the business connections of uncles and aunts? Neighbors? It turns out it's really hard to actually determine the economic value of college, or of one college vs another.<br /><br />When consumers cannot directly determine the value of a product or service, they may take a higher price as an indicator of higher quality; see, for example, the market for wine. In this case, producers may try to compete by increasing their price instead of decreasing it. <br /><br />So, the middle class finds higher education increasingly hard to afford. Could federal tuition subsidies help? Not likely. Subsidies can help improve access when given to the neediest, but if a larger fraction of consumers is subsidized, prices will increase, and then the subsidy will primarily benefit the producers rather than the consumers.<br /><br />I find solutions to the increasing cost of higher education to be murkier than in healthcare. Many people see hope in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Unfortunately, the completion rates of these programs are abysmal, and it is not clear that potential employers will accept them in place of more traditional programs. However, more competition (actual competition, not just more vendors) seems like it can't hurt.</p></div>
