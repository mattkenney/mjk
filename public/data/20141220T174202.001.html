<h2>Higher inflation &#8594; higher employment?</h2><div>Dec 20, 2014 &#8226; 12:42 PM</div><p>In response to this <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanavent">Ryan Avent</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/monetary-policy-0">article</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart">Joe Weisenthal</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/546093966979260417">asked</a> Twitter for evidence that higher inflation would lead to higher employment. There were many responses from some smart people about good monitary policy and how increased capacity utilization can lead to higher inflation, but I didn't see any &#8593; inflation &#8594; &#8593; employment evidence. I don't have that evidence either, but I have heard that story, and it goes something like this.</p><p>Some people have wealth. They want to preserve and grow that wealth for the future, so they invest that wealth in various assets with varying expected risks and returns. Because of loss-aversion, a perhaps surprising proportion of that wealth will be allocated at the very-low-risk/very-low-return end. In a higher expected inflation environment, that very-low-risk/very-low-return end of the asset spectrum will be marginally more expensive, that is, have a lower return for a given risk. That will lead assets to be invested at slightly higher risk and return, which will make those assets slightly more expensive, which will push assets into slightly higher risk, and so on. The result will be a marginal shift of assets into the kinds of productive activities that tend to buy more of both capital equipment and <span>labor</span>. The increased demand for labor will lead to higher wages, which will induce an increase in supply, that is, higher labor force participation.</p><p>Don't like my story? Want a model instead?
