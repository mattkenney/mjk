<h2>Charlie Hebdo cartoons</h2><div>Jan 7, 2015 &#8226; 4:08 PM</div><p>I've actually waivered today on whether I think news outlets should post the Charlie Hebdo cartoons that offended people, or what consideration should be given to the feelings of those who would take offense. So I made a list of pros and cons -</p><p>Pro: I have no sympathy for the idea that a supreme being has prohibited images of Mu&#7717;ammad ibn `Abd All&#257;h. </p><p>Con: There are perhaps several hundred million people in the world for whom the creation and display of images of Mu&#7717;ammad causes emotional pain. This should not be ignored just because many of us think it is wrong for them to feel that way, nor because a few people who profess the same religion have done horrible things.</p><p>Con: Declining to publish images of Mu&#7717;ammad or Andres Serrano's <span class="nom">Piss Christ</span> should not be confused with freedom of speech. Defending the right to create works that some consider blasphemous does not require everyone or anyone to republish those works.</p><p>Pro: I want to live in a world where blasphemy is a historical concept, not a force in the world.</p><p>Pro: <span class="nom">The Life of Brian</span><br/><br/><br/>Current verdict: Pro</p>
