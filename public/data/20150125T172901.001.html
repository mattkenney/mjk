<h2>Open Source is ...</h2><div>Jan 25, 2015 &#8226; 12:29 PM</div><p>On Twitter, Shane Ferro <a href="https://twitter.com/shaneferro/status/559184574413279233">pointed</a> to some interesting <a href="https://dizzynomics.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/man-of-marble-and-of-code/">questions</a> from Izabella Kaminska that hit fairly close to home for me, so here are a few thoughts.</p><p>The social structures which have co-evolved with humanity allow the control of resources to become concentrated. When this happens, the lives of the few become relatively luxurious, and the the lives of the many become relatively difficult. That is bad. (Those who do not see this as bad should read Rawls.) Piketty documented and explained how capitalism tends to move in the direction of concentration. The Soviet Union demonstrated that non-capitalism can also move in that direction.</p><p>So one question is, does the particular way the Internet has developed make this problem worse, or more granularly, what aspects of its development contribute to this problem?</p><p>First, is the behavior of Internet plutocrats very different from that of the railroad plutocrats or oil plutocrats of the past? I don't think so. The tendency of those at the top of the hierarchy to behave badly is a human constant.</p><p>What about Open Source development? This is a more interesting question. IK's analogy for Open Source development is a benefit concert, but one where most of the financial rewards flow to plutocrats. There is some truth here, but I think a better analogy for Open Source is barn raisings. Rather than a rare effort to respond to a particular tragedy, it's a way for farmers, I mean developers, to pool their resources to achieve things they couldn't on their own. If we all had to code every part of every website or service, our output would be a fraction of what it is now. In other words, software is non-rival, and trying to make it excludable would lower output much more than it would equalize distribution. If Apple and Facebook and Google and Uber had to hire armies of developers each to re-implement basic functionalities like webservers and databases, it might briefly lead to more equal distribution of income, but in the longer term, it would also entrench incumbents by making it too expensive to launch competitors like Ello or Sidecar.</p><p>Side-note: does the sharing of so many components make us more vulnerable to hacking? Possibly. As with monocultures in agriculture, a software monoculture greatly amplifies the damage a single bug can cause - see Heartbleed. On the other hand, if, for example, everyone developed their own transport-layer encryption library, there would certainly be more bugs to exploit overall, and the question of whether many small hacks would do more harm than a few big ones is hard to answer.</p><p>What about the culture? Defensive and dismissive? You bet, and it's not pretty. Soviet-like? Well, it's not centralized, and that's a big difference. It may be faddish, with everyone jumping on Ruby or NoSQL or Node and dissing what came before ("legacy code, ugh"). But those new ideas do come along, and generally get their traction with the masses, not the bosses.</p><p>What about Uberization? Does the Internet enable a few middlemen to extract exorbitant rents at the expense of both workers and consumers; do network effects prevent effective competition in online social networks, so that a few venture capitalists can become obscenely wealthy; does the Internet tend to winner-take-all? Now we're getting somewhere.</p><p>So the big question is: can we use the Internet in a way that benefits middlemen less and front-line workers more? Or do we use a Piketty solution to address the imbalance? How about both?</p>
