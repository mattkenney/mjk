<h2>Slowed productivity growth?</h2><div>Aug 11, 2015 &#8226; 6:19 PM</div><p>There has been some talk about slowed productivity growth lately, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-11/why-dismal-pay-growth-may-be-here-to-stay">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-11/productivity-barely-rebounded-in-u-s-second-quarter-after-slump">here</a> for example. Maybe there is something there, but I'm skeptical of the data for a couple of reasons:</p><ol><li><p>There is often a period of high measured productivity growth near the end of recessions, because at those times, with an improving economy, firms want to increase production, but workers still fear for their jobs. Workers work harder and overtime is under-reported. There will be reduced measured productivity growth after this period, as the labor market normalizes. There was nearly 5% measured productivity growth in 2009, and, not surprisingly, measured productivity growth was low following that.</p></li><li><p>The data is noisy relative to any trend. While reported productivity growth has been meager for the last four or five years, picking a different interval gives a different picture. Productivity growth over the last twenty years (1995-2015) has averaged 2.1%, more than the 1.6% average growth over the twenty years before that (1975-1995).</p></li></ol><p>Anyway, I'm not saying we shouldn't worry about productivity growth - it is critical - but we should do what we can to increase it no matter its level. What can we do to increase it? Why STRUCTURAL REFORM of course, bwahahaha! By that I mean <span style="text-decoration: line-through">union busting and tax cuts</span> zoning and IP reform! I think the best thing we could do for productivity growth is to make housing more affordable in areas where worker productivity is high so people can move there, and that means increasing housing supply, and that means zoning reform. Another good thing to do would be to divert resources from IP litigation towards actual R&amp;D, and that means IP (i.e. patent) reform.</p>
